A Docker image is a blueprint or template used to create Docker containers. It contains everything needed to run an application, including:
	•	The application code
	•	Runtime (like Python, Node.js, etc.)
	•	Libraries and dependencies
	•	Configuration files
	•	System tools (if needed)

🧱 Simple Analogy

Think of a Docker image like a recipe for baking a cake:
	•	🧁 Image = The recipe (instructions + ingredients)
	•	🎂 Container = The actual cake made from the recipe

You can use one image to create many containers, just like you can bake multiple cakes from one recipe.

📦 Key Characteristics of Docker Images
	•	Read-only: Once created, the image doesn’t change.
	•	Layered: Built in layers, where each layer represents a change (like installing a package or adding a file).
	•	Portable: Can run on any system with Docker installed.
	•	Versioned: You can tag images (e.g., python:3.10, ubuntu:20.04).

📁 Example: What’s in an Image?

Imagine you’re creating a web app in Python. Your Docker image might include:
	•	Ubuntu OS base
	•	Python installed
	•	Required Python packages
	•	Your app’s source code
	•	A script to start the app
