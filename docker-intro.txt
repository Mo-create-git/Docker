Docker is nothing but a software kind of things where it solves the problem where we get to listen that the application the developer had made , that software doesn't work on my my computer but it run's perfectly on yours.
Docker is open source.
Docker is mainly used to make apps,help in deployment of the project.
Docker is also used to make a virtual machine and to create a virtual ennvironment,

-virtualization & containerization.
virtualization-Virtualization traditionally means creating virtual machines (VMs) that run on a hypervisor, allowing multiple OS instances to run on one physical machine.

-containerization
Containerization in Docker is the process of packaging an application and all its dependencies into a single, isolated unit called a container. This allows the application to run reliably across different environments.
 
difference between virtualization and containerization.
Virtualization
Runs multiple virtual computers (VMs) on one physical machine.
Containerization
Runs multiple apps in isolated boxes (containers) on one OS.
Virtualization
Containerization
Uses a hypervisor to run virtual machines, each with its own OS.
Uses Docker engine to run containers that share the same OS kernel.
Each VM has its own OS + app.
Each container has just the app + its dependencies.
